Welcome to the Meme Generator
- This was my first time connecting to an API database.
- I learned about Axios (Asynxhronous JavaScript And XML) and how to use fetch and send functions to connect to an API.
- The meme Generator is a search bar that connects to an API of a gif database.
- Entering and submitting a string in the search bar returns a random gif related to the search term.
